transmute
=========

An extensible python-based XML-to-Anything generator

Transmute is a Python3.x application that accepts an XML specification of a network communication protocol, and output source code for consumption by other tools. Currently, only Wireshark is supported, but other applications can be included by adding new plugins.

Transmute was created as an independent research project during masters degree study.
